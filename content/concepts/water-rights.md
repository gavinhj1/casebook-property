Common law water rights are a complex topic in their own right and tend to vary by province — we will only skim the surface here. In order to understand the setting for *McLaren v Caldwell*, below, a few basic concepts applicable to rivers in Ontario are relevant.

A ***riparian owner*** is the owner of land bounding upon a river or other watercourse. The traditional presumption of English common law is that a riparian owner owns the bed of a ***non-navigable*** river or stream to the centre of the watercourse: *ad medium filum aquae*. Consequently, a riparian owner who holds land on both sides of a river considered "non-navigable" owns the entire riverbed and has exclusive rights to the river's use . 

The situation is different with respect to ***navigable*** waters. If a river is navigable "in fact", then there exists a public right of navigation in that river (i.e. a right to travel over it). It is, in other words, in the nature of a public highway. Title to the beds of these rivers is vested in the Crown. 

The legal definition of what makes a river navigable or not can involve a fair degree of complexity and is based heavily on the facts. For our purposes, suffice to say that, in making this determination, courts will consider whether the river is navigable along its entire length—meaning that it may be deemed navigable even if points along its length (like rapids or falls) are impossible to navigate.[^nikal1996]

Over the course of the nineteenth century, access to waterways in Upper Canada and elsewhere in the country became an integral part of the lumber industry and a primary means to bring timber from logging operations to sawmills and other points of market. From one perspective, these waterways were akin to other types of public infrastructure (like roads and railways) necessary for rapidly expanding natural resource extraction and, eventually,  industrialization. In 1847, legislation was passed to help ensure access to waterways in Upper Canada by lumber workers. The legislation stated that:[^vict1849]

> All persons may float saw logs and other timber, rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets, and no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream prevent the passage thereof.

(Here, the term "freshets" refers to the flood of a river or stream due to heavy rain or melted snow). 

A question of interpretation surrounding this provision made its way before the courts in Upper Canada in a case called *Boale v Dickson*, decided in 1863. In *Boale*, the court held that the provision above applied only to watercourses that allowed timber to be floated down them "in their natural state…without improvements". Crucially, this meant that the legislation was found not apply to non-navigable rivers where riparian owners had made them navigable exclusively by installing their own improvements.

A few decades later, after the provision above was reenacted by the Province of Ontario, the decision in *Boale v Dickson* was challenged when Boyd Caldwell & Son sought to float logs down waterways belonging to the lumber merchant Peter McLaren—waterways which McLaren had made navigable only by investing heavily in costly improvements. 

In 1880, McLaren persuaded the Ontario Court of Chancery to grant an injunction--based on the ruling in  *Boale*--restraining Caldwell from using the rivers where McLaren had made improvements. Following Caldwell's appeal of the decision, the Ontario Court of Appeal overruled *Boale* and overturned the injunction. Eventually, this decision by Ontario Court of Appeal interpreting the 1847 Act was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada but ultimately upheld by the Privy Council.

Meanwhile, the provincial legislature in Ontario attempted to intervene in the dispute between McLaren and Caldwell by enacting legislation in 1881 entitled *An Act for Protecting the Public Interest in Rivers, Streams and Creeks* (the *Rivers and Streams Act*). This new legislation attempted to clarify--*contra Boale*--that parties in Caldwell's position did indeed have the right to use rivers like McLaren's and their associated improvements, even if they were non-navigable to begin with. 

Following the enactment of the *Rivers and Streams Act* in 1881, McLaren successfully petitioned the federal government to take the extraordinary step of unilaterally disallowing the new legislation on the basis that it unduly interfered with McLaren's property rights. In the two years following, the *Rivers and Streams Act* was twice reintroduced by the province, with the federal government disallowing the legislation each time. The Act finally passed, without disallowance, in 1884. 

At the heart of this dispute was the issue of how Ontario's attempts to facilitate transportation in the lumber industry through the modification of traditional rights to property in watercourses ought to be interpreted in law. Should provincial limitations on McLaren's rights to exclude others from using the river be viewed by the courts as an expropriation? If so, what are the legal consequences of such an interpretation?

Below are excerpts from the judgements of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada in *McLaren v Caldwell*, the *Rivers and Streams Act*, and Parliamentary debates surrounding federal disallowance of the legislation. As in previous weeks, we are interested in how the features of the classical style of common law thought are influencing the decisions in these cases--here, decisions taken in both the judicial and political spheres.
