#### General Introduction ####

Over the past few weeks, we have studied the special role that common law property affords to possession and we have examined how possession relates to legal title. In the case of "unowned" things--like the wild seals we studied in *Clift v Kane*--showing physical control (plus an intention to control) amounts not only to a set of temporary rights, but to durable title as legally-recognized ownership—at least, if the animal can no longer "escape". Exactly *how* one can establish sufficient control is, as we saw, often difficult to define and heavily dependent on the circumstances. 

Last week, we turned our attention more squarely to possession and title in land in the context of common law Aboriginal title. Recalling that Locke applied his labour theory of first possession equally to personal and real property (i.e., to "things" and "land"), we saw how the application of that principle was denied to Indigenous peoples as the original inhabitants of present-day North America by the courts, who characterized their relationship to land as a "personal and usufructuary right".

This week, we continue to build our understanding of the relationship between possession and title that is so foundational to common law property. Our overarching question in Week 6 is as follows:

*Why* is title in land--as distinguished from possession of land--important? What are the justifications and consequences of the move from possession to title as part of the basic structure of a liberal market economy?

We start by taking up this question in a particular place and context: recent movements to "clarify" land titles in African Nova Scotian communities as a means to address economic disadvantage and an unequal distribution of land as a consequence of discriminatory land policies in the province. These movements have placed heavy emphasis on the regularization and formalization of land titles for individuals and families who have long been in possession of land, and can help us to understand--and develop a critical perspective on--the social and economic role of legal title.

 With this case study and the questions it raises in mind, we then move on to two crucial doctrinal points. The first of these addresses the fundamentally *relative* nature of possession and the legal rights and entitlements afforded to those in possession but who lack formal title. The second returns to Locke's idea of possession as the root of title in land in the context of a doctrine called *adverse possession*, on the basis of which a person in possession might be able to show superior rights to the party who holds formal title.  

#### Introduction to Materials ####

This week, we will explore a contemporary case study of possession and title to understand how these concepts were developed in the classical legal style and the continuing influence of that way of thinking. Several African Nova Scotian communities today are experiencing the consequences of unclear legal title to community members' lands. These circumstances "stem from a history fraught with racism, oppression and inequity"[^cameron2014]. As Justice Campbell observes at paragraphs 4-5 in *[Downey v Nova Scotia,](#downey-v-nova-scotia-attorney-general-2020-nssc-201)* below:

> African Nova Scotians have been subjected to racism for hundreds of years in this province. It is embedded within the systems that govern how our society operates. That is a fundamental historical fact and an observation of present reality.

> That has real implications for things like land ownership. Residents in African Nova Scotian communities are more likely to have unclear title to land on which they may have lived for many generations […]

Some of the history behind African Nova Scotians' unclear land title is outlined in *[Beals v Nova Scotia,](#beals-v-nova-scotia-attorney-general-2020-nssc-60)* below. Addressing this history and its current consequences helps us to understand how the interplay of possession and title to land matters. For African Nova Scotians who continue to be denied title to their lands, state demands for individuals to "prove" their possession have become both a tool of systemic racism and a means to deflect responsibility for a long history of discrimination.

Start by reading the included excerpts from the *Land Titles Clarification Act* and from *Beals v Nova Scotia* for background to this case study. We will then examine the following questions:

> What rights does the common law afford to those in possession of land (but without title)?

> What is *adverse possession* and how does this doctrine foreground the classic liberal dynamics of competition in disputes over land? 

Finally, we will return to some recent litigation in *Downey v Nova Scotia* concerning land titles in African Nova Scotian communities to examine the impact of common law doctrines around title and possession.
