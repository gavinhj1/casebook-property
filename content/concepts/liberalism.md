As a structure of legal thought, liberalism holds that all human beings should be free to pursue their own ends and, in doing so, to compete with one another to pursue those ends. The dilemma of liberalism arises when we recognize that society can only benefit from free competition when it limits individual freedoms to some degree. In other words, individual freedom for any one person—as measured by the degree to which that person is free *from* societal control—is simply impossible without putting societal limits on the freedoms of everyone else.[^citation]
