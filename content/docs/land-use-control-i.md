You've arrive in Winter term! This week, we'll begin to revisit some of last term's topics from the perspective of the **modern style**. The topic this week is *de facto* (constructive) expropriation.

**Where we're headed:** Compared to *[McLaren v Caldwell](../week8/#Water%20Rights%20and%20Expropriation)*, judges working in the modern style take a very different approach when government "removes" sticks from a landowner's bundle of rights without paying them compensation. We want to understand how this different approach emerged and how it drives decisions in the cases.
