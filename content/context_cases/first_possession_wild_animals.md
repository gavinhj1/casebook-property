Locke's argument for possession (by means of one's labour) as the basis for establishing property rights in "unowned" things and land has had a lasting influence on common law property. More important still, the way in which Locke justified his principle of first possession laid much of the groundwork for the style of classical legal thought that would come to dominate in the nineteenth century.

One historical setting in which Locke's principle of first possession became increasingly significant was Newfoundland's seal fishery. By the nineteenth century, this industry had grown in economic importance and scale. Larger boats departing from southern areas of the island began to sail further afield in the sea ice during the hunting season. As in *Clift v Kane*, it was not uncommon for sealers to kill large numbers of seals on the open ice flows only to lose access to the pelts before they could haul them aboard, as their ships were cut off by changing ice patterns due to weather, ocean currents or other causes. Sometimes, another crew of sealers would come upon the pelts and recover them. In a subsequent contest between conflicting claims to the pelts, the courts were called upon to answer the question of which party had first come into legal *possession*. That question tested Locke's seemingly straightforward application of his principle to someone who picks up an acorn off the ground and comes to possess it simply by virtue of time and effort spent. 

In *Clift v Kane*, we encounter our first case study examining how judicial decisions about common law property rules created the foundations for Canada's liberal market economy. In the context of Newfoundland's nineteenth-century sealing economy, these rules established the terms of competition between sealers and determined the preconditions for bringing their "products" to market. While both judges in the case emphasize the importance of a freely competitive marketplace for Newfoundland's seal fishery, it seems quite clear that we cannot simply take that marketplace as a given. In fact, its fundamental rules are in the process of being determined by the very case before the court. 

As you read *Clift v Kane*, start by trying to identify and describe the two different *rules* of first possession being advanced by Chief Justice Hoyles (writing for the majority) and Justice Robinson (in dissent).
