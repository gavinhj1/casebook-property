Just as it is possible to gain acquired rights through actual use of the land, it is also possible to **lose those rights through non-use**. 

- In *Saint-Romuald*, the court notes that under Quebec legislation, a "municipality may not...order the cessation of [legal non-conforming uses] unless they have been abandoned or interrupted for 'a reasonable period' no shorter than six months." 

In Nova Scotia, the *Municipal Government Act*, SNS 1998, c 18, s 240 governs the extinguishment of acquired rights for most municipalities:

> **Nonconforming use of land**

> **240** A nonconforming use of land may not be

>> (a) extended beyond the limits that the use legally occupies;
>>
>> (b) changed to any other use except a use permitted in the zone; and
>>
>> (c) recommenced, if discontinued for a continuous period of six months.

Is there a good reason to trigger the extinguishment of non-conforming uses in this way?
