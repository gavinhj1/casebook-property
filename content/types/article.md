# ARTICLE = I'm not really sure what this one should be called - to include excepts from journal articles, but also reports, books, book chapters, etc -- maybe one or more types 
# SUGGESTION (Gavin): Could call it 'secondary_sources' if all of those are being included? Though a single word might be prefereable
