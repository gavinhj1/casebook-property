So far in Unit 2, we have focused on issues of possession and title and their interpretation in the classical style. Those issues mainly addressed the question of how property is established and given recognition. We now turn to a second set of issues that deal with the *content* of property rights held by owners or those in possession.  

One right in particular, some argue,[^exclude] is fundamental to property: the *right to exclude* others from interfering with the owner's use and enjoyment of their land, other tangible things and even intangibles like knowledge goods. For better or for worse, this notion that a right to exclude defines property probably aligns with familiar everyday experiences. It was at the heart of the disputes in both *[Harrison v Carswell](../week2/#Harrison)* (right to exclude from the mall side walk) and *[Moore v Regents of the University of California](../week3/#Moore)* (right to exclude from the cells of one's body).

The common law has devised several remedies to enforce an owner's right to exclude. We have already seen a few examples in Unit 1. In *Harrison*, the mall owner brought an action in *trespass* against the picketer Sophie Carswell to exclude her from the mall sidewalk, while the plaintiff in *Moore* made a claim in *conversion* in his attempt to exclude the defendants from using his cells after they were extracted from his body. Both of these are causes of action in tort that are based on an owner's right to exclude others from interfering with their property.

This week, we will look at a third tort action that engages owners' rights to exclude, but which also—reciprocally—implicates other owners' rights to use their property as they wish. This is an action in *nuisance*. I know that you are currently studying (or will be studying) nuisance doctrine more fully in your torts class. Our focus here will be somewhat narrower. We will explore nuisance law as a "property tort" for what it can tell us about how judges in the style of classical legal thought address the clash of private property rights between neighbours. The material we cover will largely be distinct from—but, hopefully, mutually reinforcing with—the material you study in torts this year.

Our focus this week is on just one aspect of nuisance doctrine: the question of *remedy*. Once a nuisance has been established on the facts (as it is in all the cases we'll study), should courts grant an *injunction* to prevent the nuisance-causing activity or should courts award *damages* to compensate the plaintiff for their losses? The former option most effectively enforces the owner's right to exclude, while the latter essentially forces the owner to accept payment as compensation and thereby allows defendant to proceed with an ongoing infringement of the owner's exclusionary rights.

### The Bundle of Sticks

When trying to explain the common law's particular (and sometimes idiosyncratic) understanding of "ownership", lawyers and judges frequently invoke the "bundle of sticks" metaphor—as in, "ownership is like a bundle of sticks"—the "sticks" being the various property rights that make up the ownership "bundle". 

The basis of this metaphor is that ownership is not really a uniform collection of rights that one either has (ownership) or does not (no ownership). Instead, the bundle of rights asks us to interpret ownership as a very malleable legal concept, difficult to pin down to any particular arrangement or bundle. One landowner might have an unrestricted right to use their land in any way they like, while another might have certain use rights taken out of their ownership bundle—say, by a land use ordinance or environmental regulation restricting where and what they can build. We would likely call both landowners an "owner", even though they hold quite different sets of legal entitlements. 

This "bundle" view of property raises the question: if stick after stick is eliminated from the ownership bundle, at what point does one cease to be an "owner" at all (this was one of the fundamental disagreements between the judges in *Moore*)?
