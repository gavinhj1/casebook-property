So often in law school or in legal practice we are presented with two opposing arguments and asked to explain why one side of the argument is better, or correct, or more persuasive. Sometimes there is a clear answer to this question. Some arguments are simply right or wrong on the facts or law. But probably more often the answer requires an understanding of nuance, style and judgement--and an appreciation for the historical context in which those arguments are made. That context will be a main focus of our course this year. But before we engage with history we will spend a few weeks trying to understand why this historical context actually matters for legal analysis. 

This week and next, we will read two cases: *Harrison v Carswell* and *Moore v Reagents of the University of California*. These cases present some intriguing legal controversies: public access to shopping malls in *Harrison*; property in the products of one's body in *Moore*. But our primary interest in these cases is not about their subject matter or the details of the legal doctrine. Instead, we read both cases because they contain excellent illustrations of the typical patterns of common law argument.

### Key point

Common law arguments are highly patterned, and the structure of those arguments — though not necessarily the outcome of arguing — is fairly predictable. These patterns of argument recur again and again in the cases we will read this year. Becoming proficient in common law arguments means being able to recognize and make use of these patterns.

The patterns I am talking about here occur at two different levels. At one level are the specific forms of argument and counter-argument we commonly see in courtroom settings and judicial decisions. For example, one party argues:

> Plaintiff has a right to do X (such as, exclude other people from their property).

The other party responds:

> True, but these facts justify a limitation on plaintiff's right to do X in the circumstances.

There may be many possible argument pairs like this based on any set of facts, but because common law arguments are highly patterned we should be able to recognize those patterns across different cases with different issues and facts.

At another level are the broader historical currents in legal thought that determine which forms of argument and counter-argument are more likely to be seen as persuasive, in context, at any given time.

A good way to think about all this is to draw an analogy to language.[^stein2018] Learning to speak a new language requires you to learn a whole new set of words that make up the language—i.e., its *vocabulary*. But to actually learn the language, you need to learn not only its vocabulary but also its *grammatical structure*—i.e., how the words fit together to form coherent thoughts expressed in that language. 

The recurring forms of legal argument and counter-argument we will learn to recognize are the basic units of common law vocabulary. This week and next, we will practice the skill of identifying these argumentative patterns.

Next, in Unit 2, we will start to uncover the deeper "grammatical" structure of common law property by studying how changing ideas about the market and the state influence and constrain the legal vocabulary of judges and lawyers during different historical eras. But for now, you can set to one side this idea of legal grammar and focus first on the vocabulary of common law arguments.
