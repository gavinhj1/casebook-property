### Review

This week, we will continue to practice analyzing the patterns of common law argument that we started to see last week in *Harrison v Carswell*. Before jumping into the material for this week, it is worth taking a moment to refresh your memory about [why we are reading these cases](../week2/#key-point) in the first unit of our course.
